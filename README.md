## Description

Swimz provides you with extra information and statistics about your swim data from the Health app. You can add swim data manually to your Health app or use a fitness tracker or smartwatch to automatically add swim data.

Swimz will provide you with information about your current, average, best and total swim distance over different time periods.
You can also set a week goal and see your progress.
Default distance units from your Health app will be used.

You can set up notifications when reaching your week goal and optional see your current distance on the app icon on your home screen.

Swimz respects your privacy. All your data will stay on your device only.


In order to work correct, Swimz needs read access to your swim data.
